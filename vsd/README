==================
 PBRT-VSD Worflow
==================

* Introduction
----------------
This workflow will generate pbrt configurations from the point sprite data to
simulate the fluorescence detection by a two-dimensional sensor that's placed
over the cortical surface.
The resulting rendering reflects the fluorescence distribution on the sensor
and also the total photon counts.

* How to use
----------------
There are two approaches to run this workflow. You can use your own machine
as a sequential solution, but it might be very slow for handling an entire
time-series.
To do that, update the configurations in the ./run.sh script and execute it.

The second approach would allow you to use the cluster "Lugano only". It creates
several batch script to handle a single time step per node. To do that, update the
parameters in the script ./run_on_cluster.sh, and execute it.
